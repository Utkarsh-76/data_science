      "But what makes the future distinctive and important isn’t that it hasn’t happened yet, but rather that it will be a time when the world looks different from today.\n",
      "The Chinese have been straightforwardly copying everything that has worked in the developed world: 19th-century railroads, 20th-century air conditioning, and even entire cities.\n",
      "Between the First World War and  Kissinger’s trip to reopen relations with China in 1971, there was rapid technological development but not much globalization.\n",
      "This age of globalization has made it easy to imagine that the decades ahead will bring more convergence and more sameness.\n",
      "My own answer to the contrarian question is that most people think the future of the world will be defined by globalization, but the truth is that technology matters more.\n",
      "If every one of India’s hundreds of millions of households were to live the way Americans already do—using only today’s tools—the result would be environmentally catastrophic.\n",
      "Then, after 10,000 years of fitful advance from primitive agriculture to medieval windmills and 16th-century astrolabes, the modern world suddenly experienced relentless technological progress from the advent of the steam engine in the 1760s all the way up to about 1970.\n",
      "From the Founding Fathers in politics to the Royal Society in science to Fairchild Semiconductor’s “traitorous eight” in business, small groups of people bound together by a sense of mission have changed the world for the better.\n",
      "Positively defined, a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future.\n",
      "This book is about the questions you must ask and answer to succeed in the business of doing new things: what follows is not a manual or a record of knowledge but an exercise in thinking.\n"
